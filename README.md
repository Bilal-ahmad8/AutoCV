First need to Extract the Contextual Job using - Agent 1

Optional (Can also Extract data from the Job with the same Agent 1 using ExtractWebBrowserTool )

Using Selected Job Url can extract Job description and requirement using - Agent 2

Using Existing Information + Job description make a more informed Resume / CV with ATS Score of atleast 90%.

To build an intelligent agent that finds the most suitable job for a user based on a **user profile** and a **set of job descriptions**, you need to combine **semantic matching**, **ranking**, and possibly **machine learning** or **embedding-based similarity** strategies.

Here are key approaches and tools you can use:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Text Embedding-Based Semantic Matching**

### **Goal:** Compare the semantic similarity between the user profile and job descriptions.

### Tools:

* **OpenAI Embeddings (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`)**
* **Hugging Face models like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (via SentenceTransformers)**
* **FAISS** (for fast nearest neighbor search)

### How it works:

1. Convert user profile and job descriptions to embeddings (dense vectors).
2. Compute cosine similarity between the user profile and each job description.
3. Rank jobs by similarity score.

### Why it works:

This approach captures *semantic meaning*, not just keyword overlap. So "project manager" and "program lead" are considered similar if contextually aligned.

## ‚úÖ 2. **Keyword/Skill Matching with Weighted Scoring**

### **Goal:** Score how well the job requirements match the user‚Äôs skills/experience.

### How to do it:

* Extract structured data from both inputs:

  * Skills, experiences, qualifications.
* Define a scoring rubric:

  * Direct skill match = +2 points
  * Related skill match = +1 point
  * Missing required skill = -3 points
* You can use NLP tools like **spaCy**, **keyword matchers**, or **NER models** to extract info.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **Rule-Based Filtering**

Use this to eliminate jobs that clearly don‚Äôt match, for example:

* Required years of experience
* Mandatory certifications or degrees
* Location/remote preferences

This narrows the pool before similarity scoring.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **Fine-Tuned Classification Model (Advanced)**

If you have labeled data (job, user profile, and match score), you can train a supervised model.

Model types:

* Fine-tuned BERT-style classifiers
* Siamese networks for pairwise ranking

Input:

* Pair: (user profile, job description)
* Output: Match score or binary "match / no match"

---

## ‚úÖ 5. **Multi-Criteria Ranking**

If you want to include more nuance:

* Use **learning to rank** methods (e.g., RankNet, LambdaMART)
* Combine:

  * Similarity score
  * Experience match
  * Skill match
  * Industry/domain relevance

Normalize and weight each factor to create a composite score.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. **LLM-Based Matching (Zero/Few-Shot)**

If you're using GPT-4, Claude, or similar:
You can prompt the model with:

> ‚ÄúGiven this user profile and this job description, how strong is the match on a scale from 1 to 10? Explain why.‚Äù

You can use this:

* As a fallback where embeddings don't work well.
* For top-k shortlist refinement.

---

## ‚úÖ 7. **Evaluation & Feedback Loop**

To assess effectiveness:

* **Precision\@k**: How many top-k matches are truly relevant?
* **User feedback loop**: Let users rate the suggested jobs.
* **A/B testing**: Try different ranking strategies and compare outcomes.
